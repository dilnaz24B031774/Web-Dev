        <p>Today I started learning programming. I created my first web page using HTML.
            It feels exciting to build something from scratch and see it work in the browser.

        <p>This week I learned how to use CSS to style web pages. I changed fonts, colors,
            and spacing to make my blog look cleaner and more readable. I'm starting to
            understand how websites are built.</p>
